The aim of this project is to understand the inner workings of basic Machine Learning algorithms by implementing the algorithms from scratch using numpy and python standard libraries.
The algorithms implemented are:
Neural networks
Clustering with K-means and K-means++
K-nearest neighbors
linear regression
logistic regression
